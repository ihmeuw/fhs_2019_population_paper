"""
Comparing UNPD and our reference scenario in terms of cumulative births from
2017 to 2100, the largest differences by super-region are in sub-Saharan Africa (887路93
million); south Asia (628路97 million); and southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania (402路14
million). While the global difference in cumulative births is 2.16 billion, differences
in cumulative deaths are dramatically smaller, accounting for only 117路42 million deaths
globally from 2017 to 2100.
