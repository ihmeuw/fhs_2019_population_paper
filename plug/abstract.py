The global total fertility rate (TFR) in 2100 is forecasted to be 1.66 
(95% UI xxâ€“xx).  In the reference forecast, the global population is projected
to peak in 2063 at 9.7 (UI)  billion people, and decline to 8.7 (UI) in 2100.
The reference projections fore the 5 five largest countries in 2100 are India
(1067 million ([UI), ], Nigeria (791 million[(UI])), China (716 million([UI])),
USA USA (335 million [(UI)]), and DR Congo (246 million [UI]). Findings also
suggest a shifting age structure in many parts of the world, with XX individuals
above the age of 65,  and XX individuals below the age of 20, globally in 2100.
By 2050, XX countries will have a TFR below replacement and XX below
replacement by 2100.  XX countries including China, XX, XX and XX in the
reference scenario will have declines of greater than 50% from 2017 by 2100.
Alternative scenarios suggest meeting the SDG targets for education and
contraceptive met need will result in a global population of 6.2 billion in
2100, and 6.8 billion assuming 99th percentile rates of change in educational
attainment and met need for contraception. Forecasts from this study differ
from the UNPD and the Wittgenstein Centre, which project 10.9 billion and 9.3
billion people globally in 2100, respectively. The difference with UNPD in 2100
is due to XX million fewer people in the reference scenario in sub-Saharan
Africa and XX million in other regions, primarily due to the level of fertility
achieved in below replacement populations. China is expected to become the
largest economy by XX but in the reference scenario the USA would once again
become in the largest economy in XX.
