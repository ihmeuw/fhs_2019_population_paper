# GKModel

```
run_cod_model.py
Run a cause-of-death model using the appropriate strategy for the input
acause and save the results.
```

```
run_all_cod.py
Run run_cod_model.py by acause and sex.
```

```
downloaders.py
Functions for reading in the drivers.
```

```
qa.py
Functions for saving the data
```

```
capping_mt.py
The capping method.
```

```
GKModel.py
GKModel is a subclass of the PyMB model class. It allows for ease of data
prep as long as the expected variables are included in a DataFrame which
is passed in at the initialization step of the class.
```

```
GKModel.py
Source code in C++
```


# Aggregation and ARIMA

```
aggregate_mortality_with_arima_error.py
This module aggregates the expected value of mortality up the cause
hierarchy and run ARIMA on the residuals.
```

```
RandomWalk.py
RandonWalk model which runs an independent random walk model for every time
series in the dataset.
```

```
PooledRandomWalk.py
Pooled random walk for cause specific, whose location pooling dimension is based on cause level√ü
```

# Squeeze
```
squeeze.py
Module for squeezing results into an envelope. The envelope starts with
_all_star.nc in the hat_star_dot directory and is generated by squeezing
Children causes into their parent envelopes.
```

```
run-squeeze.py
This is a script for running squeeze.py for all of the causes in the
Heirarchy.
```

```
ar1_utils.py
This module provides functions to help create the all-cause ARIMA ensemble.
It is called by aggregate_mortality_with_arima_error.py on the epsilons (error)
between the modeled past and the past data to create a time series into the
future. The intent is to capture any time trends that remain after the
Explanatory variables have been incorporated into the model.
```

```
gk_intercept_shift.py
Intercept shift at draw level for mortality.
```
